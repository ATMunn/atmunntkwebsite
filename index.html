				Hello! I'm ATMunn. Welcome to my website.
			</h1>
			<div>
				I'm just a random guy on the internet who likes a bunch of different things. I live in the USA, in the state of Ohio.
				Down below are also links to my Projects page and Articles page. 
			</div>
			<div>
				Projects range from web experiments, to music, to games, and more.
				The Articles page is a page full of interesting educational articles written by me to teach you about various things I find interesting in an easy-to-understand manner.
			</div>
			<div>
				Where can you find me elsewhere? Good question. I have both a YouTube channel and a Steam account. However, I'm fairly inactive in both.
				I won't link them because there's no real reason to. But you can find them pretty easily.
				By the way, please don't send me friend requests on Steam if I don't know you. I won't accept it.
			</div>
			<div>
				I also have a GitHub account. That's linked down below.
				In fact, the source code for this website is on there. It's hosted with GitHub Pages.
			</div>
			<div>
				You can find me on IRC on both EsperNet and Freenode. My nickname is ATMunn on both. 
				I'm in various different channels on Freenode, but I'm always in #factorio on EsperNet.
